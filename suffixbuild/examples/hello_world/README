  To build:

     1. make sure that quickbuild is built in ../..
        by running 'make' in ../.. or 'make -C ../..'
        from in this directory

     2. run '../../quickbuild' from this directory

     3. run 'make' from this directory

     
     
     
     
     Put another way just run:

       make -C ../.. && ../../quickbuild && make

     from this directory.



  'GNUmakefile' in the directory above lets you build all the example
  packages by running 'make' in the directory above.  That will do all the
  configuring and building of all the packages.
