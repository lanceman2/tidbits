This directory is here so that the plugins/ directory is in a crts/
subdirectory and the binary executables may find plugin module files with
a relative path.

Example: the program crts_radio gets installed in

   PREFIX/bin/crts_radio

and all the RadioInput modules get installed in

   PREFIX/share/crts/plugins/RadioInput/

which is a very standard arrangement that many packages use; that is:
PREFIX/share/PACKAGE_NAME/plugins/PLUGIN_CATEGORY/.  We keep the source
with this same directory structure so that the uninstalled programs can
run in the build directories and use the same relative path to find the
plugin files.

See for yourself, on a GNU/Linux system, run 'locate plugins' and see the
output.  This is at least a de facto standard.
