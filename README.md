## About

So I'm dabbling in new programming paradigm, language, or software
package.   I don't have package that has this in it yet, and I would like
a repository to idea's, notes, and/or code in.  This is it.  If the dabbling
turns into good fruit it may become, or get merged into a project; and
removed from here, or kept here to prosperity or reference.
