# install_eosio

A bash script to install EOS.IO

This is an attempt to install the EOS software without using your home
directory to install dependencies, and letting you specify a any prefix
for EOS and all the dependencies.  The install scripts that come with EOS
(tag v1.6.0) do not let you do this.

## Ports
For installing ESO on; currently just Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS
